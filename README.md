``` bash
git add <file_name>
```
To add all changes:

```bash
git add .
```
### 3. Commit Changes
Commit your changes using git commit:

git branch <branch_name>

```
### 7. Switch Branches
Switch between branches using:

``` bash
git checkout <branch_name>
```
### 8. Merge Branches
Merge branches together with:

``` bash
git merge <branch_name>
```
### 9. Clone a Repository
Clone a remote repository to your local machine with:

``` bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

### 10. Push Changes to Remote
Push your changes to a remote repository using:

``` bash
git push origin <branch_name>
```

### 11. Pull Changes from Remote
Pull changes from a remote repository with:

``` bash
git pull origin <branch_name>
```
